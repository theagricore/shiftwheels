# 🚗 ShiftWheels

ShiftWheels is an **e-commerce application for buying and selling used cars**, built with **Flutter** and **Firebase**.  
It’s designed to make car trading simple, transparent, and efficient — focusing only on vehicles, unlike general classified apps.

## 🧠 Story

The idea for **ShiftWheels** came about 4 months ago when my family decided to buy a car.  
We had a limited budget, and it was tough to find a good car through existing apps — most were general classified platforms not focused on cars.  

That’s when I thought:  
> “Why not build an app only for cars, with all the features in one place?”

And that’s how **ShiftWheels** was born.

## 🛠️ Stack I Used

- **Flutter** → Chosen for its cross-platform support, allowing me to build for both Android and iOS with a single codebase.  
- **Firebase** → Used for Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and real-time updates (especially for chat).  
- **Cloudinary** → Handles image storage and optimization for car photos.  
- **Clean Architecture** → Keeps the codebase modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.  
- **BLoC (Business Logic Component)** → Used for state management to maintain predictable and organized app flow.  
- **Razorpay** → Integrated for premium account payments.
